I posted this on Facebook earlier today, and I want to post it here so I don't
lose it.

First, go ["The Virus Changed. Now We Must 'Get to Zero' or Face Catastrophe"
over at The Tyee](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2021/01/28/Virus-Changed-Get-To-Zero-Face-Catastrophe/).

We're staring down the barrel of several much more infections strains of
COVID-19 because the government ( provincial or federal ) failed to properly
lock us down to get us to zero -- not bending or flattening the curve,
zero. They failed to implement the testing protocols to know where the virus was
so they could quarantine people, or buildings, or cities. They failed to give
proper assistance to everyone so that they could safely stay home until we had
gotten to zero.

New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iceland -- there are countries that got this
right. And now rather than trying to "bend the curve", they're basically at
zero. Compare that to a place like LA, where hospitals are out of oxygen and
there's no point calling an ambulance because there's no room in any
hospital. Right now, we're headed for LA, not New Zealand.

Yes, I'm frustrated that I've been stuck inside for basically a full year
now. I've been lucky: I've been able to work from home, and have been able to
shop online for groceries, and don't have any needs that require I leave the
house often. It sucks that I haven't seen friends or family in person since
basically January. I'm furious that since March there have been people who have
flaunted the rules and have either infected others or had absolutely no
repercussions -- while frontline health workers are being traumatized, day after
day, for trying to save lives.

It breaks my heart that there are people who have to choose between being safe
or being able to eat and have a roof over their head. I'm terrified that this is
going to infect the people I care about because they either have to go into
work, or go into a hospital for non-COVID-related reasons.

The best time to have fully locked down properly; with a mortgage & rent
moratorium with no "repayment plans", massive fines for landlords that try to
evict or businesses that open, as well as food and supplies and money for bills
provided on a weekly basis to those who need it -- the proper time for all that
was back in March. The second best time is now.

And if you're wondering "well what can I do"? If you live in Canada, [go her to
find your MP and give them a call](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en/search).
If you live in BC, [go here to find your MLA and give them a call
too](https://www.leg.bc.ca/learn-about-us/members). Tell them you want a full
lockdown. Tell them you want the government to build a plan based on the success
of New Zealand and Taiwan. I called my MP Nelly Shin and my MLA Selina Robinson
today. I read from a script because I'm not good at phone calls,
and you can read that script
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VslX1XCwXp0scZ8bfaVRxPGWtoVxt2UHk3uNIpCyIM8/edit?usp=sharing).

Tell them you want them to help the people who have lost jobs or homes, and not
their landlords that evicted them or the businesses that let them go. Tell them
they should tax the millionaires and billionaires who have made incredible
profits in the last year ( while so many have lost jobs, or homes, or even the
ability to work at all ) so that they can pay for all that needs to be done.

And if me saying all this makes you upset, makes you think I'm talking about you
specifically: maybe examine that feeling a bit. Maybe think about all the people
who have either died, are going to die, or will have their lives impacted by
this virus. Think about how we could have been pretty much done with this whole
fucking situation if we had done the right thing, at the start.
