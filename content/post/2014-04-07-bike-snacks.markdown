Since I started at [ThoughtShop][1], I've been biking to and from work most days. The route I take is generally about 8km, and takes me 30 or 40 minutes, depending on whether I'm going to or from work. On the way to work, it's mostly downhill -- so the way back is mostly uphill. I try to go for a longer ride once a week or so, something that takes me at least an hour, and keeps my heart rate up.

The first week I started biking, I picked up a few Cliff energy bars. I found that they have helped quite a bit -- whether I'm on a long ride or a short one. I only picked up five, so I ran out of them pretty quickly. I've been meaning to go back and get some more since I ran out.

So today on my way home I took a slight detour and went to the [MEC in North Vancouver][2]. I picked up sixteen energy bars, but I decided to try out a bunch of different types and flavours. I picked up a few different [Cliff][3] bars, some [Pro Bars][7], some [Luna][4], a few [Power Bar][5], and a single [Gorp][6]. I tried one of the Luna bars on my way home, a Lemon Zest -- it was pretty good! I'm curious to see how all the rest of them taste. Having some variety for when I go for bike rides will be pretty awesome, plus they also work pretty well for hikes.

I'm looking forward to trying out all the bars I bought. Hopefully none of them are duds.
