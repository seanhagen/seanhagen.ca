If you haven't heard of Golden Frog & Vypr VPN, they're pretty awesome. Vypr VPN is a paid VPN service that masks and protects your internet connection. Want to make sure that sites can't track you, or that your data is secure on it's way to and from the site, or just want to get around some silly content restrictions? Vypr VPN is the tool for you.

They're having a contest right now for a few awesome prizes:

* Weekly Prizes - Two 1-year VyprVPN Premier Accounts (winners announced each week)
* Grand Prize - Xbox One (winners announced Jan. 2)
* Second Prize - Nexus 7 Tablet (winners announced Jan. 2)

I highly recommend you check them out ( and not just because this post gives me entries to their contest ):
