So, this week has been pretty awesome.

On Tuesday, I went to the open house at the [Vancouver Hackspace][1]. I've been meaning to check out their new space for a while now, and I finally went down. It's a pretty awesome place. They've got a pretty good setup, with lots of tools and stuff for people to use, and lots of actual workspace for actually getting stuff done. I spent most of the night talking with a nice fellow named Dave, trying to help him get his 3d printer working. I also found out that he has his ham radio license, so I was asking him some questions about that too.

Yesterday, something that I had ordered at PAX 2013 showed up: [Machine of Death][2]! I got the game plus the red box expansion, so I've got a ton of cards. I definitely need to set up a few games nights. My GF got [Dominion][3] plus an expansion for Christmas, and about a month ago I bought [Ladies & Gentlemen][4] -- and we haven't had a chance to play any of them. I've played Dominion before, and it was pretty awesome. I've never played the other two though, and I'm really looking forward to trying them out.

Today was my birthday! I'm officially 28 now.

This evening my sister, my GF, and I went out for dinner at [The Reef][5]. Great place. They're taking part in [Dine Out Vancouver][6], which is an awesome annual event here in Vancouver. If you have a chance, go to a few restaurants doing the Dine Out Vancouver stuff. It's a great way to check out some restaurants that are either too expensive normally, or places that you might not go normally.

My parents got me a [Raspberry Pi][7] ( that's not the exact one that I got, but Adafruit is a pretty awesome site, so if you want one, get it from there! ), which I'm pretty excited to play around with. I've got a few project ideas that the Raspberry Pi might be perfect for.

Tomorrow I'm going to Incindios and The Alibi Room after work with some friends, so that should be a barrel of monkeys.

This has definitely been a good week.
