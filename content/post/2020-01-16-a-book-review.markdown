Hey! It's been a while. I... didn't do so well at writing more stuff last year, huh?

Well, let's fix that.

I recently finished reading Invasive, and I'm nearly done The Swarm. I'd have
finished The Swarm already but there's an issue with my ebook copy -- it's
missing the last part. The book doesn't really have chapters; it's split into
five parts and each part has multiple sections with headers. That's besides the
point though. The point is that my copy is missing the climax of the book. And
in the process of trying to get a full copy of the book so I could finish
reading, I lost all the annotations I made in my Kobo.
