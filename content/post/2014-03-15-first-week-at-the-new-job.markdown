So, I've been working at [Thought Shop](1) for a week now. I guess I should write down some of my thoughts on what I think so far.

To summarize: holy awesome, batman.

I don't know if it's because I've never worked for a design shop before, or if it's going back to work for a small company, but I'm really loving this job so far. I've spent the entire first week learning how to use [ThreeJS](2) for my first project. I've never worked with 3D in the browser before, so it's been a pretty fun week. Also, maybe it's working at a small company, or getting to play around with something new and exciting, but this week has felt _super_ productive.

It started out pretty simple. On my first day I was handed a prototype that one of the other developers had done as a proof of concept to test out ThreeJS. I spent my first day turning that JavaScript into a [Yeoman](3) powered project, using [Gulp](4). This is the first time I've used Gulp instead of [Grunt](5), and I have to say I'm pretty impressed -- so far, it seems like a huge improvement over Grunt. The next few days I spent playing around with the model in [Blender](6) to split it up a bit ( for reasons I'll get into in another post ), and learning me some ThreeJS.

I know it's only been a week, but I really think I'm going to like it here. I have the feeling that I'm always going to have a chance to try out new web technology, and to play around with it. I also think that I'm going to have the freedom to play around, to try out different things to find what works for each project -- instead of having to rush and try and get stuff done as quickly as possible.

I'll see how the next few weeks go, but I think this is the start of something pretty awesome.
