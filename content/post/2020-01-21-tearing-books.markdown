Saw this tweet today:

And I have... feelings.

## Book Lover

On the one hand, I think this is a terrible thing to do to a book. One reason is
the book will forever look horrible when it's sitting on your shelf. I'm not
usually much for aesthetics, but I guess shelves full of books brings out my
inner aesthete. 

Another, more fundamental reason is second-hand books.

This is one of my all time favorite books:

But that's not what my copy looks like. It looks like this:

I bought it second-hand. I don't remember what used book store I bought it at,
but I do remember that it wasn't in the greatest condition when I bought it. 

All I remember is that I wanted a book to read for a trip, and this one looked
neat and I figured why not, it's only $PLACEHOLDER. I've read it a bunch of
times since then. I've read a bunch of other stuff by [Peter F
Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_F._Hamilton) -- pretty much
everything except the Greg Mandel trilogy & Misspent Youth. That book opened up
several new amazing and interesting book series to me, so this copy will always
have a special place in my heart.

However.

I highly doubt that the store would have tried to sell the book if it was in the
state it's in now.
