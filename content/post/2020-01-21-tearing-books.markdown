### On One Hand

I think this is a terrible thing to do to a book. 

This is one of my all time favorite books:

My copy isn't some pristine version, though. Here's what mine looks like:

I know it doesn't look pretty, but how it looks tells a story. 

I bought it second-hand. I don't remember what used book store I bought it at,
but I do remember that it wasn't in the greatest condition when I bought it. 

All I remember is that I wanted a book to read for a trip, and this one looked
neat and I figured why not, it's only $PLACEHOLDER. I've read it a bunch of
times since then. I've read a bunch of other stuff by [Peter F.
Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_F._Hamilton). I've read the
Commonwealth Saga and the Ngiht's Dawn trilogy several times now. Peter
F. Hamilton is now one of my favorite writers. I recently bought
[Salvation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068552-salvation) simply
because he had written it and I figured I'd probably enjoy it.

I own this book as an ebook as well, and sometimes I still prefer reading the
physical copy. It's opened up several new amazing and interesting book series to
me, so this copy will always have a special place in my heart. 

I highly doubt that the store would have tried to sell the book if it was in the
state it's in now. They probably wouldn't buy the book from me if I brought it
in as it is now.

If I buy a book that I'm not a big fan of it'll end up in a box that ends up at
the second hand book store. Those books turn into store credit so that I can try
and discover other books I might love. If they wont' take it, I find a library
that can put the book in a box that they'll sell for a fundraiser or something.

Maybe it's because some of the books I've enjoyed reading came from my dad and
the second hand store, but I don't really view myself as the final owner of any
of the physical books I own. I'm a caretaker. Some books are only with me for a
short period of time, others will be with me for decades. 

My copy of Pandora's Star isn't one that I'll sell for store credit so I can get
something new to read. I'm hoping it'll be something that passes on to my
children that sparks a love of reading ( and hopefully well-written sci-fi ).

So in that light, cutting a book in half feels... just wrong. Not sacrilegious,
just... bad. It feels like you're saying that the book has no future, that the
only thing left for it is the trash. Every new person that owns or reads a book
is another life for that book, another person the book has a chance to inspire.

### On The Other Hand

I totally understand wanting reading a book to be a pleasurable experience. If
you don't have an ereader and want to read a book, sometimes the only option is
a fuck-off huge doorstopper. I've read one or two in my time, and it's not
really an enjoyable experience. 

And I know that speaking as a healthy person I don't have it anywhere near as
bad as someone with an injury or disability that makes it hard to hold a book
for an extended period of time. Apparently it's kind of a common problem for
folks who need books with larger fonts -- the books end up being massive and
unwieldy and not fun to read.

So I'm fully on board with someone modding a book so that reading it is
something they'll enjoy. 

I'm not going to say "oh they should just get an ereader". It's 2020, if someone
doesn't have an ereader they've got their own perfectly valid reasons for not
having one. Hell, I have an ereader and I still sometimes prefer buying the
physical copy of a book.

I guess I just wish there was a way to ensure that the book could continue to
find new homes and entertain new readers. I'm not sure if libraries take books
that have been modified in this fashion -- I know they can rebind books, but I'm
not sure they'll take a book that _requires_ rebinding ( it's probably a service
reserved for well-loved books they already own ). Maybe there are services
online that will take books and repair them so they can be sent to libraries
that are hurting for donations. Pro-bono book rebinding.

At the end of the day, I'm not going to tell someone the way they read books is
wrong. What matters more to me is that they're out there reading, enjoying the
work and craft of all the authors out there. If it means that maybe some books
have to get cut in half and don't get a second or third or fourth life, then
I'll just have to be okay with that.

### Why Here

I put this here instead of on Twitter for two reasons. The first is holy hell do
you see how long this thing is? I'm not trying to type that out on Twitter. The
second is that I'm trying to not jump into these kind of Twitter dramas right
away. It's not good for my mental health ( or anyone else's, I bet ). So I
figure it's better to take some time to think, write out my full thoughts, and
post them here. Because that's what this is for, isn't it? The long, rambling
thoughts that are too big for Twitter threads?
