And so begins our one week vacation in Montreal, Quebec City, and the surrounding area!

Started by getting up at the un-*godly* hour of 4:30am. For someone who normally gets out of bed at around 8:30am, that is a ridiculous time to be waking up. While chowing down on a cheese bun we quickly checked over our bags and mental packing lists to make sure we had everything. We were out the door by 4:50am.

It was a bit weird being on the road that early. I'm not used to the streets being that empty. The most cars we saw at once before hitting the airport was a group of four we saw on Granville ( all headed to the airport, of course ). It's kind of nice making good time on streets that normally give me issues, but at the same time there's a bit of a weird post-apocalyptic vibe -- although that could just be me spending too much time in places like [/r/bugout](http://reddit.com/r/bugout) and thinking about zombies lately.

Time to get on the plane. I'll update once we're in Edmonton -- we've got a one-hour layover there before the final leg to Montreal.

Arrived in the Edmonton airport and got ourselves something to eat. Only an hour until our next flight! Woo!</scarcasm>.

We picked up bagels from a Tim Hortons we found. There are a ton of stores in this airport. They've got a little mini-Chapters, several electronics store, and a jewelry store fer chrissakes. They've also got plenty to choose from in terms of food options. We only got bagels because we wanted a quick snack after the flight -- I'm going to be picking up some Quiznos to take on the plane, and I'm sure Marie will be picking up something too. I can see why YVR wants to expand their facilities to have more stores -- asides from keeping people happy, it probably generates a ton of revenue.

So, I'm just going to be sitting here people watching. Got a nice spot opposite our gate, where I can watch all the people wandering to and fro.

First observation: some people have pretty ridiculous carry-on bags -- some of the stuff I've seen is probably an inch away from being required to be checked in.

Also, plenty of people with roller luggage who prefer to carry it. I just don't get that one.

Unless something super eventful happens, I'll update in Montreal.
