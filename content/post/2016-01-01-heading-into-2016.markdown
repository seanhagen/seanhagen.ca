title: Heading Into 2016
---

So it's the end of another year. I didn't write a post last year, but after [seeing this post](http://whatthefuck.computer/blog/2015/01/01/2014-how-did-i-do/), I figured I should make a record of things that I want to try and accomplish in the new year. This isn't a list of resolutions, just some stuff I want to try and get done.

## Make Art Stuff

A few months ago my girlfriend got [The Hand-Lettering Ledger](http://www.amazon.ca/Hand-Lettering-Ledger-Practical-Illustrated-Hand-Drawn/dp/1452125589), and I recently started doing some of the excersizes. So far I've been haivng a lot of fun playing around. I want to try and do some practice every day, so that one day I can make some awesome stuff like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/_8-_hpiu7J/) or [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/_9Oa4nCu4n/).

I also want to do some other stuff: make some stuff with clay ( that I can maybe mold and make castings of ), maybe get into sketching, and find some models to paint. I've just spent so long creating purely digital things. I don't have the space to make the bigger projects I'd like to work on, and places like [VCL](http://vancommunitylab.com/) don't really work for me. So until I've got my own area to work on larger projects, I'll work on some smaller stuff.

I've also got [642 Things To Write About](http://www.amazon.ca/642-Things-Write-About-Journal/dp/1452105448/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451719296&sr=8-1&keywords=things+to+write+about), and I want to spend some time every week doing some writing. That's related to me trying to blog more often; I've got some bits of story ideas that I'd like to try turn into some short stories or something. I need to practic writing though, because I feel like I'm a bit out of shape.

## Get A Jeep

I've been meaning to do this for a while now. It's the first step in getting ready for the big road trip I want to do in the next five years or so. This one is fairly simple -- I've just got to save up $10,000. It might not actually take that much; I've seen some good looking Jeeps on Craigslist for as little as $4000. That's actually about how much I sold mine for when I moved downtown forever ago, so I'm not surprised that there are other people selling theirs for the same amount.

## Completely Pay Off Credit Card

I bought my laptop ( as well as few other things, mostly from [Massdrop](http://massdrop.com)) on my credit card. I'd like to get my card completely paid off before the end of the year. It shouldn't take too long, I've just got to be disiplined about how I use my credit card this year.

## Get Healthier

Over the last year I got a bit chubby, but I've also done some good stuff for me. I quit smoking, and I've been trying to walk instead of taking the elevator in my building. Over the next year, I'd like to start counting the calories in what I eat. It's worked for me in the past, and I lost quite a bit of chub doing it. I'm also going to try and make the effort to be more active -- maybe go to the gym or go biking more.

My girlfriend and I also want to go for more hikes and camping trips this year.

## Consolodate Tools

A bit of a problem that I'm having with my digital stuff is that I feel like I've got too many tools and things. Between Evernote, [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), Google Inbox, Feedly, Slack, IFTTT, and a few other things, I feel like I've got too many bits all over the place.

A few years ago I had Emacs set up to do most of my stuff, and I'd like to give that another go. I've heard some good things about [M4ue](http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html), which I'm hoping can stand in for Google Inbox. I also want to try and find a way to use a combination of Org-mode and other Emacs things to maybe replace Evernote. The other stuff ( RSS feeds, etc ) I'd like to bring into Emacs as well.

## Hopful New Year

Plenty of things that I want to try and do in the coming months. It may take a while to do some of them, but I think with a solid plan everything on this list is totally do-able.

Anyways. Hope you all have a great new year.

Happy 2016, folks.
