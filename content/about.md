### Who The Hell Are You

I'm a developer living in near Vancouver, British Columbia. I've worked for a
wide variety of companies in the past, but always doing stuff related to web
development. I cut my teeth as a youngin on **Perl**, later picking up
**PHP**, then moving on to **Ruby**. 

For the last few years though, I've been a full-fledged **Go**pher. 

I'm also intruiged by hardware stuff like the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I'm not a
great electrical engineer, but I keep trying. One of these days I'll manage to
keep the magic smoke in the chips.

### Gettin Creative

I'm also the co-host of a tabletop RPG podcast: [DMs of
Vancouver](http://dmsofvancouver.ca). My co-host Jessy and I talk to our friends
and guests from the industry about various things you can do to be a better GM
at the table. 

I've also got a bunch of other creative hobbies, which are all documented here
on this site.
