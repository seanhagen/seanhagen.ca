### Who The Hell Are You

I'm a developer living in near Vancouver, British Columbia. I've worked for a
wide variety of companies in the past, but always doing stuff related to web
development. I cut my teeth as a youngin on **Perl**, later picking up
**PHP**. For a few years I mostly used **Ruby**, but lately I've been using
**Go** for everything -- and it's awesome.


### Gettin Creative

Lately I've started doing some more creating stuff. I'm a co-host on the [DMs of
Vancouver](http://dmsofvancouver.ca), a podcast that goes over a variety of
topics about D&D and being a DM. I'm also a co-host on a soon-to-be-released
podcast; A Guy, a Girl, and a Vampire Slayer -- a Buffy the Vampire Slayer
re-watch podcast. 

### Anything Else?

I'm also learning how to do more hardware based stuff with [Arduino](9) and the
[Raspberry Pi](10). I'm not the best at soldering yet, but I'm getting better.


### Social?
