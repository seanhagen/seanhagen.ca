summary: When a the fires raging in the forests blanket a sleepy town with a
    strange smoke, what will the townsfolk find?
---

Tom knew that he had left getting supplies until the last minute, like
always. The forest fire had been on the news for a few days now. Every report
had it getting a bit closer to Skeena[^1]. And now that a mandatory evacuation had
been called he had to wonder if there were any supplies left in town at all. He
had been watching folks leave town for days now, ever since folks had been able
to see the glow from the fire at night.

outline:

* tom has to go into town for supplies before heading out of town to his cabin
* has to leave town because a raging forest fire is threatening the town, town
  has to be evacuated
* on way into town, he noticies that the smoke from the fire seems to be far
  ahead of the actual blaze, but writes it off as a quirk of the wind 
* stops at gas station to fill up 
* a few people are in the gas station, including a parent who left their kid in
  the car while paying for gas and getting supplies
* while paying waiting to pay for gas, the smoke arrives, far ahead of when it
  should have arrived 
* tom (retired firefighter) and firefighter who was her way to the fireline
  caution people to stay inside, the smoke doesn't look right
* customers are unsure if they should stay inside or not, parent who left kid in
  car refuses to stay inside, goes outside
* terrible things happen ( just to arm, or do they die? )
* rest of customers freak out, 
* tom and firefighter lady manage to get people to calm down
* a few hours pass, smoke is still weird, but something is outside, everyone can
  see a shape moving, it's not a person
* 
* baracade
* 
* rumbling thunder and green lightning
* 
* creature attacks again
* 
* smoke passes, the sky is weird -- the night sky is dominated by a purple
  nebula, with things flying in it 
* the countryside has changed, something huge is walking on the horizon 
* tom & sarah look at each other, and start to talk about what they could do
  next, including just killing themselves
