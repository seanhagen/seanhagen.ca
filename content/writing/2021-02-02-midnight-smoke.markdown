summary: When a the fires raging in the forests blanket a sleepy town with a
    strange smoke, what will the townsfolk find?
---

outline:

* tom has to go into town for supplies before heading out of town to his cabin
* has to leave town because a raging forest fire is threatening the town, town
  has to be evacuated
* on way into town, he noticies that the smoke from the fire seems to be far
  ahead of the actual blaze, but writes it off as a quirk of the wind 
* stops at gas station to fill up 
* a few people are in the gas station, including a parent who left their kid in
  the car while paying for gas and getting supplies
* while paying waiting to pay for gas, the smoke arrives, far ahead of when it
  should have arrived 
* tom (retired firefighter) and firefighter who was her way to the fireline
  caution people to stay inside, the smoke doesn't look right
* customers are unsure if they should stay inside or not, parent who left kid in
  car refuses to stay inside, goes outside
* terrible things happen ( just to arm, or do they die? )
* rest of customers freak out, 
* tom and firefighter lady manage to get people to calm down
* a few hours pass, smoke is still weird, but something is outside, everyone can
  see a shape moving, it's not a person
* 
* baracade
* 
* rumbling thunder and green lightning
* 
* creature attacks again
* 
* smoke passes, the sky is weird -- the night sky is dominated by a purple
  nebula, with things flying in it 
* the countryside has changed, something huge is walking on the horizon 
* tom & sarah look at each other, and start to talk about what they could do
  next, including just killing themselves
