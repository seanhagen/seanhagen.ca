I've recently got into playing Dungeons & Dragons, [DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master)-ing for two groups of friends.

As part of learning how to DM, I've been reading a lot ( and I do mean **a lot** ). What to do, what *not* to do, tips, tricks, etc. One of the better resources I've found is [Papers & Pencils](http://www.paperspencils.com/). He hasn't been so active recently, but there are some great things in there.

In the campaign I'm running, I wanted to have encumberance, and I wanted travel to be more than the players simply stating "we travel to X". So, after doing some looking around, I found two great articles on Papers & Pencils: [one on encumberance](http://www.paperspencils.com/2012/03/18/making-encumbrance-work/), another on [making travel more engaging](http://www.paperspencils.com/2012/03/05/making-travel-more-engaging/). After reading them, here's what I've settled on so far. This is very much open for tweaking, as I figure out what works and what doesn't work for my players. A lot of this is copied pretty much vertabim from the Papers & Pencils post, so all credit goes to [Nick Whelan](http://www.paperspencils.com)!

## Encumbrance

The rule is pretty simple.

Items are either **significant** or **insignificant**. Characters have a limited number of encumberance points. Insignificant items don't cost any encumberance points. Most significant only cost 1 encumbrance point. Exceptionally heavy or unwieldy items may have a score of 2.

A significant item is basically any that is heavy or large enough for a character to take notice when it's added or removed from their equipment. For the most part it's just DM fiat, but a good rule of thumb is that if it weighs less than 5 lbs, it's not significant.

For higher scores:

* if you need two hands to hold it ( a chest with stuff in it ), it's 2 points
* if it requires two hands and probably would require more than one person to carry if it wasn't in a backpack, it's 3 or even 4 points

Consumables count in "packages". Some examples:

* 1 week of rations
* 20 pieces of ammo ( eg, arrows/bolts/shurikens/throwing axes/throwing knives/etc )
* 5 bags of caltrops, flasks of oil, torches, etc
* 250 coins of any demonination

A character's carrying capacity is their Strength (STR) score. Quadrapeds ( ie, horses, mules ) can carry double their STR in points.

Up to a character's STR is a light load.

From there to 2xSTR is a medium load, and with a medium load their speed is reduced by 1/4.

From 2xSTR to 3xSTR is a heavy load, and their speed is reduced by 1/2 **plus** they have disadvantage on any attack rolls or any STR or DEX based checks.

Over 3xSTR a character simply can't move.

So, a character who has a STR of 12 has twelve points of encumbrance. Above 12 points they're carrying a medium load. From 24 to 36 is a heavy load. Above 36 points they can't move.

## Travel

The reason for figuring out encumbrance is so that you can figure out how quickly characters can travel.

A character's travelling speed is their speed minus five. The party travels at the speed of the character with the lowest speed ( unless they want to split up... ).

Travelling on a hex map uses a certain number of points, depending on the terrain that they're travelling over:

| **Terrain** | **Examples** | **Movement Cost** | **Becoming Lost** |
| :-------: | :--------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Easy    | road, city    |       4       |  No Check     |
| Average | clear, grasslands, trail* | 6 | Survival, DC 10 |
| Moderate | forest, hills, desert, badlands | 8 | Survival, DC 15 |
| Difficult | mountains, jungle, swamp | 12 | Survival, DC 20 |

* There's no Survival check for following a well-marked trail

Moving into a hex uses up points. If the players are about to move into a hex that would use more points than they have remaining, the DM has to let them know. If they choose to continue, then it's a forced march.

### Side Note: Searching

While travelling, parties are travelling through hexes that are 6 miles wide. That's a pretty big area -- to travel through it and only use the minimum number of points, they travel in as straight a line as they can manage. If the party wants to thouroughly search a hex, they have to spend movement points to search the hex properly. Spending 1/4 of the points required to travel through the hex searches a quarter of that hex.

An idea that I'm playing around with is that if players are searching for something ( for example, Wyvern Tor in the Lost Mines of Phandelver ), then each time they spend some points to find something in a hex, they have a chance of finding whatever it is they're looking for. On the first time they search, they have a 25% chance of finding it, the second 50%, the third they have a 75% chance, and if they search a fourth time they've fully explored the hex so they just find it. However, each time they search, they have a chance of running into something nasty. Each time they search, a d20 - use the standard encounter rules ( on a 17-20, they encounter something, roll on the encounter table to find out what ).

### Side Note: Encounters

While reading over the module for Lost Mines of Phandelver, I found the encounter table they suggest using for the area.... lacking. It's the same list of enemies, no matter where on the map you are. So I came up with [my own encounter table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoCp9LFpINMSAp2kAEmelnzzJu4wDpgfCLvTttRWCVw/edit?usp=sharing). It has some bad stuff, some not so bad stuff, and some good stuff. The best things only happen once, and then the stuff that shows up on a lower roll happens instead.


## The End!

So that's what I've got so far. This will probably evolve over time as I actually get some more experience as a DM. If ( & when ) things change, I'll make new posts. If you've got any feedback, leave it in the comments below!
