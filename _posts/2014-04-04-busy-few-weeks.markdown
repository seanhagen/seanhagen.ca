Man, these last few weeks I've been busy.

I don't know what it is exactly.

Part of it is probably the fact that I'm still getting used to my new mode of transportation -- biking to and from work. The new job is actually closer than the previous one, so it only takes me half an hour to bike to work, and about forty minutes to bike back home.

I think another part is that I'm starting to figure out a proper morning routine that involves eating breakfast before I head out. I'm also realizing that if I want to be able to get up in the morning, I really can't stay up late -- which is kind of a bummer. It's probably just a bad habit, but my brain really seems to get into gear late at night. In the past it's when I've gotten most of my work done on personal stuff. But when I stay up until 1am, it's nearly impossible for me to get out of bed before 8:30am -- which kind of sucks. I'd like to be leaving between 8am and 8:30am so that I'm at work between 8:30am and 9am.

I've been researching [OrgMode](1) as a way to organize my life. I've seen a bunch of stuff online that makes it sound like it's a great agenda and planner, as well as being a good way to organize thoughts. While researching org, I've come across "[Getting Things Done](2)", or GTD, which sounds like it might help me get all my stuff in order.

I say that because I've been thinking about scheduling some time blocks every week to set aside for working on various different things. I'd like to set aside some time every day to write ( I really want and need to write posts more often about the stuff I'm working on ), as well as block out some time specifically for hacking away at Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and programming projects.

First steps first though: sit down and read the Getting Things Done book. I think this weekend I'm going to try and do that. I'd also like to organize all the various project ideas I've got, either in Trello or using OrgMode ( or [both](3) ). I'd like to have at least a rough outline of each project, probably in a README, that defines what the project is, what I hope to get out of it, and what I'd consider a "complete" state for the project.
