So, last weekend I finally made a purchase I've been thinking about for a few months now. I picked up the [FitBit Aria](https://www.fitbit.com/aria) and the [FitBit Flex](https://www.fitbit.com/flex).

Personal metrics is somtheing that I've been interested in for a while. A while ago I got a [Garmin Edge 500](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/cycling/edge-500/prod36728.html) so that I could track my bike rides. I also picked up a [Mio Link](http://www.mioglobal.com/Mio-LINK-Heart-Rate-Band-Grey/Product.aspx?ProductID=14) so that I could track my heart rate too -- I didn't want to get the [chest strap heart rate monitor](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/fitness-sensors/soft-strap-premium-heart-rate-monitor/prod15490.html) because it just seemed super unconfortable. I'd much rather have something on my wrist than wrapped around my chest.

Anyways.

A few years ago I tried to lose some weight and get more fit by counting calories. It actually worked pretty well for me. I think it was mostly the fact that I became much more aware of how much I ate. I had a hungry week or two, but once my stomach adjusted I was eating less than before but I wasn't getting as hungry. So I'm giving it another go. Hopefully (when paired with biking to work) I should be able to lose a few inches.

I'm also looking forward to all the fun graphs and whatnot I'll be able to create once I've been doing this for a bit longer. At ThoughtShop I installed a few tools that let me get all sorts of fun graphs and charts about the metrics from the application I was working on. Getting to do the same thing but for my own personal metrics -- that seems like it'll be pretty cool.
