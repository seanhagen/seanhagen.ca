### Who The Hell Are You

I'm a developer living in near Vancouver, British Columbia. I've worked for a wide variety of companies in the past, but always doing stuff related to web development. I cut my teeth as a youngin on [Perl](1), later picking up [PHP](2). For the last few years, I've been using [Ruby](3) to get stuff done -- although lately I'm picking up [Go](4) and [Clojure](5). I've also spent the last few years learning all sorts of fun [DevOps](6) stuff like [Puppet](7) and [OpenStack](8).

### Anything Else?

I'm also learning how to do more hardware based stuff with [Arduino](9) and the [Raspberry Pi](10). I'm not the best at soldering yet, but I'm getting better.
